The mesh is defined in one Matlab file region.mat while the neighbours of each element and the related structures are in neighbours.mat. Some variables are redundant.

***
In region.mat the variables are

nedges

number of edges for each polygon
row vector (1 x ne)

---

BBox

Bounding box for each polygon
4 coordinates per element, namely [x1, y1, x2, y2] with (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) the coordinates of the left-bottom and right-top corner of the box, respectively.
matrix (ne x 4)

---

ne

number of elements
integer

---

coord

Complete collection of the vertices coordinates
matrix (nv x 2)

---

coords_element

list of (xi,yi) coordinates for each vertex of each polygon
cell (1 x 100).
Each cell: (nedges x 2)

---

region.connectivity

Indexes of the vertices in coord that compose each polygon
cell (100 x 1)
Each cell: (1 x nedges)

---

area

area of each polygon
column vector (ne x 1)

---

max_kb

DG-penalization parameter for each edge of each polygon
cell (1 x ne)
Each cell: (nedges x 1)

---

In neighbour.mat the variables are

nedges

number of edges for each polygon
row vector (1 x ne)

---

neigh

IDs of the neighbouring elements across each edge for each polygon.
If the edge is a portion of the boundary, the ID is a negative number indicating a tag for imposing BCs.
cell (1 x ne)
Each cell: (1 x nedges)

---

neighedges

Array-position of the current polygon in the neighbours list of the neighbouring element
cell (1 x ne)
Each cell: (1 x nedges)
