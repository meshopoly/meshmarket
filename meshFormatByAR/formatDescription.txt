Description of the file
-----------------------

This type of format is used in the matlab library EZVEM by Alessandro Russo.
You can find this code and a brief description of it at

The mesh is described in only one file and 
the points indexes starts from 1. 

The first row contains three integers that are:
- number of points 
- number of edges (both internal and the ones on the boundary)
- number of polygons

For instance, a file with the following first line:

22 31 10

will contain a mesh with 22 points, 31 edges and 10 polygons.

Then, there is the list of the x y coordinates of the point.
For instance, we can have:

5.793826e-01 4.340973e-01
4.302699e-01 1.468728e-01
4.235629e-01 0.000000e+00
1.000000e+00 0.000000e+00
1.000000e+00 2.848848e-01
5.096612e-01 5.246791e-01
5.044576e-01 5.455796e-01 

After the list of points the list of edges immediately starts.
For each line an edge is described with three integers
- the first endpoint 
- the second endpoint 
- the marker

The marker is a positive integer to identify the boundary edge and 
which boundary an boundary edge belongs to. 
For example, in a square there are 4 boundaries and it is possible to put a different marker for the top, bottom, left and right boundary.
As a consequence a mesh edge can have the marker 1,2,3 or 4 to identify the top, bottom, left and right boundary

A possible list can be:

1 2 0
1 5 0
1 10 0
2 3 0
2 13 0
3 4 1
3 18 1
4 5 1

Finally, there is the list of polygons. 
Each line corresponds to a polygon and it is organized as follow:
- the first integer is the number of points that defines the polygon
- then there the sequence of points' ids that are stored in a counter clok wise order.

For instance, the line 

8 1 10 6 9 11 12 13 2 

Represents a polygon with 8 points, that is composed by the points identified by 1, 10, 6,... 2.

There is a last (optional) data block.
A sequence of integers equal to the number of polygons that associate a marker with a polygon.
This can be extremely useful, if we would like to solve a problem characterised by multi materials.
