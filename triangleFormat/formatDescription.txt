Description of the file
-----------------------

This is the mesh format used by the c library triangle by J.R. Shewchuck for Delaunay mesh generation.
You can find both the code and a more detailed description of the file format at the web site 

https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html


The mesh is described in three files. 

- ***.node contains the list of mesh node 
- ***.edge contains the list of mesh edges 
- ***.ele contains the list of triangles 

The ".node" file 
----------------

The first line contains 
- the number of vertexes, 
- the dimension (which is always 2),
- the number of attributes associated with the point, 
- the boundary marker 

For instance, a possilbe header of a ".node" file can be 

13  2  3  1

that has 13 vertexes, the dimension is 2, there are 3 attributes for each node and there is the boundary marker.
Then, there is the list of points stored as 
- id
- x coordinate
- y coordinate
- the list of attributes 
- the boundary marker 

For instance, the line 

3  0.  10.  0.3 0.2 0.4 1

represents the point which has the identifier "3", its x coordinate is 0., the y is 10.,
it is associated with three attributes (the first one is 0.3, the second one is 0.2 and the last one is 0.4) and 
it belongs to the boundary of the mesh.

The ".edge" file 
----------------

The first line contains
- the number of edges
- the boundary marker 

For instance, a possilbe header of a ".edge" file can be 

28  1

that has 28 edges and there are the boundary flag.
Then, there is the list of edges that are stored as
- id of the edge
- the first endpoint according to the numbering in the .node file 
- the second endpoint according to the numbering in the .node file 
- an integer to set the marker of the edge. 

Also in this case if the marker is 0, the edge is internal and does not belong to the physica boundary of the mesh.

For instance, the line 

5 10 2 8

corresponds to the edge with the identifier 5, 
that connects the points with the identifier 10 and 2
in the corresponding .node file, whose marker is 8. 

The ".ele" file 
----------------

The first line contains 
- the number of triangles 
- the number of points connected 
- 1 if threre is a triangle marker, 0 otherwise

For instance, a possilbe header of a ".ele" file can be 

16  3 1

that has 16 edges and for each triangle and at the end of each line there will be an integer representing its marker.
Then, there is the list of triangles that are stored as
- id of the triangle
- the first point according to the numbering in the .node file 
- the second point according to the numbering in the .node file
- the third point according to the numbering in the .node file  
- an integer to set the marker of the triangle.

The first, second and third triangle's vertexes are stored in a counter clock wise order.

For instance, the line 

   4       2     6    11 3

corresponds to the triangle with the identifier 4, 
that connects the points with the identifier 2, 6 and 11
in the corresponding .node file, whose marker is 3.
