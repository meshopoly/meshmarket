Description of the file
-----------------------

This format is derived from the meshes generated in the Matlab library Polymesher
(see ../paulinoFormat)
although it contains only the minimal information to construct the mesh:
no neighbors of other structures are saved here.

The example vtk file provided is in ASCII format (not xml).
It contains a VTK POLYDATA in the following form:

POINTS (number of points in the header)
coordinates of each mesh vertex (2D -> 3rd coordinate = 0)

POLYGONS (number of polygons and total number of edges in the header)
number of edges of the polygon, followed by list of indices of its vertices (as in POINTS)

CELL_DATA (number of polygons in the header)
cell tags: one for each polygon
